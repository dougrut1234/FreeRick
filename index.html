<p>
  Rick Sanchez has turned himself in –brah! He has been arrested for the supposed murder of Tammy, a secret agent for the Galatic Federation who totally gipped Birdperson into marrying her! Rick Sanchez is a devoted a father to Beth Smith, father-in-law to Jerry Smith, grandfather to his partner-in-crime Morty Smith and Summer Smith. He was last seen on “small Earth” and was going to get where ice cream is.

  He turned himself into to let his family go back to planet Earth. We believe that he is completely innocent and not only innocent but also consider he is remorseful for his supposed crimes. His cellmate asked him what he was in for and he responded “everything.”

  Justice for Rick! Donate now towards his defense fund.
